# PYTHON-project
 The objective of the project is to finding the movie records from the dataset which is provided.First we load the dataset/file through the import os then given the file path with read command.This command can access the whole file easily.For accessing without any exceptions we load the dataset

**Default dictionary** 
         A defaultdict works exactly like a normal dict, but it is initialized with a function (“default factory”) that takes no arguments and provides the default value for a nonexistent key.
         A defaultdict will never raise a KeyError. Any key that does not exist gets the value returned by the default factory.In this project the exceptional handling is used while finding the outputs and some of the predefined functions etc.
